Craft a cURL request that will retrieve a random artist using the view you just created


curl -u admin:admin \ "${COUCH_ROOT_URL}/music/_design/random/_view/artist?startkey=ruby -e 'puts rand"



● As you can see here, the URL pattern to query for views is
/<database_name>/_design/<design_doc>/_view/<view_name>
